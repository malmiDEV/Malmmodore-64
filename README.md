# Malmmodore-64
i wrote c64 emulator in rust

## MY THOUGHTS
```
if you think better way to learn "how cpu works" its just emulate one of them
sounds crazy, but i think its a best way learning about cpu.
if you write a emulator you have to learn lot about how that cpu actually works.

i think every programmers should wrote their own emulator especially in rust
because its fun and pretty good way to explore new language and how computer actually works.
